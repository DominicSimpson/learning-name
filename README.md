###### Pulling from the main remote branch to the local in GitHub now makes much more sense, as I have found when working on the HTTP project. This was particularly the case when we deleted a remote branch called semantic-html, yet it still remains locally (i.e. on VSC on my computer). This helps me visualise the difference between local and remote, and the distinction between the two.

###### It's interesting to see the contrast between my own tests in the Learn Integration Testing workshop, on the index.test.js page, on the sample calculator provided, and contrastingly those of the solutions. The use of the parseInt and parseFunction functions are problematic; what if therer were 30 arguments to pass in? In that case, the input argument would have to be automatically converted beforehand into a floating point number. 
Some examples of my own:
